name: prototype
description: Build throwaway code that answers a design question — a driveable state model, or several structurally different UI variants to choose between. Use when a state machine, data shape, or interface has to be felt rather than argued about, and the discussion has stopped moving on prose alone.
admission:
  provides: A cheap concrete artifact to react to — a state model someone can click through, or variants that can be compared side by side — turning a design argument into an observation, plus the discipline that keeps the artifact out of main afterwards.
  cost: Per invocation, a throwaway artifact, the branch that keeps it out of main, and the pass that folds the validated decision into real code.
  remove_when: Design questions about state models and interfaces are settled before implementation often enough that building something runnable stops changing the answer.

# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered — from the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → [references/logic.md](references/logic.md). Build a single shareable HTML file — free-play buttons plus tabbed guided walkthroughs — that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper, and that a non-developer can drive.
- **"What should this look like?"** → [references/ui.md](references/ui.md). Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts — getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and clearly marked as such.** Locate the prototype code close to where it will actually be used (next to the module or page it's prototyping for) so context is obvious — but name it so a casual reader can see it's a prototype, not production. For throwaway UI routes, obey whatever routing convention the project already uses; don't invent a new top-level structure.
2. **Trivial to run.** A UI prototype starts from one command in the project's task runner — `pnpm <name>`, `python <path>`, `bun <path>`, etc. A logic demo is a single HTML file the user double-clicks. Either way, no thinking required to start it.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE — wipe me" name.
4. **Skip the polish.** No tests, no error handling beyond what makes the prototype _runnable_, no abstractions. The point is to learn something fast.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Capture it when done.** Fold the validated decision into the real code, then keep the prototype itself as a **primary source**: commit it to a throwaway branch, out of main. Record the verdict and the question it settled — `work note <id> "<verdict, and the branch holding the prototype>"` on the work item the prototype was answering for, or in the commit message if no item owns it. The main branch keeps only the validated decision.
