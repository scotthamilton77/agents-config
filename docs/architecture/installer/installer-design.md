# Installer — Architecture & Design

> **HLD artifacts**: see [`index.md`](index.md) for the C4 (L2 container / L3 engine), sequence, and data-view diagrams derived from this spec. This document is the design-of-record; the diagrams visualise it and are amended in step.

## Purpose

A `uv`-managed Python package (`packages/installer`) that installs agent configuration from this repo into AI coding assistant homes (`~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.gemini/`, OpenCode XDG). User-facing entry point is `scripts/install.sh`, a thin `exec uv run --project packages/installer python -m installer` stub. This repo is the first Python subproject in a modular monorepo; its layout is the template for future Python subprojects.

## Architecture

### Design principles

- **Tool-agnostic core + tool adapters** — the merge engine, staging engine, and sync engine are pure and tool-agnostic; tool-specific behaviour (OpenCode XDG path, OpenCode skips shared `agents/`, Gemini frontmatter transform, Codex placeholder extensions) lives in per-tool adapter modules behind a `ToolAdapter` protocol.
- **Merge strategies are separate classes** — append-merge, JSON union, last-wins-warn, fatal, etc., each in its own module under `core/merge/strategies/`, each testable in isolation, dispatched through a registry.
- **Pure core, injected I/O** — engine modules under `core/` are pure functions; all terminal interaction routes through the `IOPort` protocol (`TerminalIO` real, `ScriptedIO` test fake). No module calls `print`/`input` or imports `rich` directly.

The `ToolAdapter` protocol abstracts everything the engine needs to know about a tool:

```python
class ToolAdapter(Protocol):
    name: str
    def source_dir(self, repo_root: Path) -> Path: ...
    def dest_dir(self, home: Path) -> Path: ...
    def is_detected(self, home: Path) -> bool: ...
    def scoped_namespaces(self) -> tuple[str, ...]: ...
    def should_install_namespace(self, ns: str, source: str) -> bool: ...  # OpenCode: False for shared agents/
    def post_staging_transforms(self, plan: StagingPlan, io: IOPort) -> StagingPlan: ...  # Gemini frontmatter
```

The core engine takes a `ToolAdapter` and a source root; tests substitute a `FakeAdapter` to exercise the engine independently of any real tool.

`MergeStrategy` protocol:

```python
class MergeStrategy(Protocol):
    def merge(self, existing: StagedItem, incoming: StagedItem) -> StagedItem: ...
```

Each strategy class lives in its own module with its own test file. `core/merge/registry.py` provides the `(FileKind, namespace) → MergeStrategy` lookup (namespace is unused for non-namespaced kinds — see §"Data model highlights"), easily swapped in tests.

### Dependency management — `uv`

The installer is a `uv`-managed Python project. `pyproject.toml` declares deps; `uv.lock` is committed. Users invoke via `scripts/install.sh` (the exec stub) or `python3 scripts/install.py` (direct entry).

**Python floor:** ≥3.11 (broad availability; stdlib `tomllib` for reading TOML).

**Runtime deps (targeted, not stdlib-only):**

- `pyyaml` — for the Gemini frontmatter transform.
- `tomli-w` — to write `installer.toml` updates (3.11 stdlib reads TOML; it does not write).
- `rich` — pretty diffs, colored output, prompt formatting.

The dependency list is deliberately tight, but we no longer refuse a library that exists and solves the problem.

**Dev deps:** `pytest`, `pytest-xdist`, `ruff`, `mypy` (strict). `uv tool run` is the local invocation pattern.

### Configuration — `installer.toml`

Structured TOML at `packages/installer/installer.toml`, parsed by `core/installer_toml.py`'s `load_installer_toml`. Its only table is `[tools]`:

```toml
[tools]
# Optional per-tool dest-dir overrides — leave commented to use built-in adapters.
# claude.dest = "~/.claude"
```

**Designed, parsed, but not yet wired.** `load_installer_toml` has no caller in the live install path — there is no `Config.tool_overrides` field, and dest resolution goes through `adapter.dest_dir(home)` everywhere (including the prune scan), so a declared override has no runtime effect today. Threading the parsed overrides into dest resolution is a deliberate later story; the schema ships now so the loader is forward-compatible.

Pruning is **not** configured here. It is driven by the **install receipt** (`~/.config/agents-config/install-receipt.json`) — a record of every wholesale-authored entry the installer wrote, diffed against the desired staged plan to find orphans. See [`data-view.md`](data-view.md) §"Install receipt — the persisted prune authority" and [`sequences.md`](sequences.md) §"Sequence 4 — Prune flow"; the authoritative design is `docs/specs/2026-06-25-install-receipt-pruning-design.md`.

### `--dump-stage` flag

A debug mode that materialises the in-memory `StagingPlan` to a directory and exits without touching destinations:

```
python3 scripts/install.py --dump-stage /tmp/stage-debug
```

Writes the full plan as a real directory tree (`<dump>/<tool>/...`), prints the dump path, and exits 0. Useful for debugging template flattening, plugin overlay, and collision resolution without committing to a destination write. Mutually exclusive with `--prune`/`--prune-only`.

### `IOPort` protocol

Single injectable abstraction (`info`/`ok`/`warn`/`err`/`header`/verbose variants/`show_diff`/`confirm`/`confirm_three_way`/`confirm_per_item`/`is_interactive`). Two implementations: `TerminalIO` (real, uses `rich`) and `ScriptedIO` (test). No module reaches for `print`/`input` directly.

### Data model highlights

- `Tool` is an enum for exhaustive type-checking; `ToolAdapter` instances live in a registry keyed by `Tool` value. Plugins are **not** enumerated — they are discovered dynamically by scanning `src/plugins/<name>/` and registered by name string, so adding a plugin requires no code change to `model.py`. `PluginAdapter` instances live in a string-keyed registry. Per-`StagedItem` provenance is tracked via a `Provenance(kind: Literal["tool","plugin"], name: str)` dataclass so tool-vs-plugin origin survives the asymmetry.
- `FileKind` enum keys `MergeStrategy` dispatch in `core/merge/registry.py` on **`(FileKind, namespace)`** because `NAMESPACED_MD` items need their parent-dir namespace to pick the right strategy (e.g. `(NAMESPACED_MD, "rules")` → append-merge; `(NAMESPACED_MD, "commands")` → fatal). For non-namespaced kinds (`SETTINGS_JSON`, `JSONC`, `TOML`, `OTHER`, `DIR`) the namespace component is unused and the lookup degenerates to a `FileKind`-only key.
- `StagingPlan` is the in-memory staging structure — a `dict[Path, StagedItem]` plus provenance tracking.
- `Orphan` dataclass carries tool (owner), namespace, path, and kind for each recorded receipt entry that is in scope but no longer in this run's desired staged plan (and passes the path trust boundary).
- `Receipt` / `ReceiptEntry` are the installer's only persisted-between-runs state: a record of every wholesale-authored dest entry (`path`, `owner`, `root`, `kind`, `sha256`), behind an `integrity` digest, serving as the sole prune authority. Never records a merge-target.
- `Config` is frozen; today it carries only `home`, `tools`, and `auto_yes`, populated from argv + auto-detection probes (which themselves consult adapters). `plugins`, `dry_run`, and `dump_stage` are resolved separately in `cli.py` and threaded directly into pipeline calls rather than through `Config`. `installer.toml` is parsed but not yet wired into `Config` or any consumer (see §"Configuration — installer.toml"). `Config` carries no prune fields — pruning is driven by the `--prune` / `--prune-only` argparse flags and the install receipt.

## Test architecture

Three suites under `packages/installer/tests/`. Target ~120–150 tests, full run under one minute.

### Unit (`tests/unit/`, ~80–100 tests, <2s)

Pure-function tests against the core engine, exercised through a `FakeToolAdapter` so each module tests in isolation. Examples by module:

- `core/templates.py` — directive recognition; ALL-RULES join; trailing-newline preservation; Gemini frontmatter strip + tools-list YAML conversion.
- `core/merge/strategies/append_rules.py` — empty/non-empty concat; separator placement.
- `core/merge/strategies/json_union.py` — nested dict precedence; array union+dedupe (first-seen order); type mismatch; key only in incoming.
- `core/merge/strategies/fatal.py` — raises with informative message including filenames.
- `core/merge/registry.py` — `(FileKind, namespace)` dispatch correctness; unknown key raises.
- `core/receipt_diff.py` / `core/prune_hash.py` — `scope_owners` + `diff_orphans` against the desired staged plan; `validate_entry` trust boundary; `is_prunable` hash/type partition (prune vs relinquish).
- `core/io_port.py` (`ScriptedIO`) — consumes scripts in order; raises on exhaustion; records transcript faithfully.
- `tools/<name>.py` — each adapter's `is_detected`, `dest_dir`, `should_install_namespace` rules tested independently.

### Integration (`tests/integration/`, ~30–40 tests, <30s)

**Behaviour-driven, not implementation-driven.** Fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/states/` and represent versioned snapshots of *user-state-before-install*: clean home, normal-user-with-existing-config, conflicting-rules, orphans-present, corrupted-settings, legacy-backups-present, plugin-overlay-active, etc. Each fixture is a real directory tree the test can `shutil.copytree` into `tmp_path`.

Tests assert **end-state goals**, not how those goals were achieved:

- "After install against the `normal-user` fixture, `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` content matches the source."
- "After install, the user's pre-existing `settings.json.user-keys` are preserved."
- "After `--prune --yes` against `orphans-present`, the orphan files are gone AND their pre-prune content is recoverable from a backup directory."
- "After install with the test-plugin active, the plugin's rule appears appended to the matching base rule, separated by `\n---\n`."

Test names describe the contract, e.g. `test_user_modified_settings_keys_are_preserved_after_install`. Implementation details (which phase touched what, which strategy fired) are not asserted; the strategy is tested at the unit level.

### Fixture strategy

- `tests/fixtures/states/` — versioned, on-disk, hand-curated snapshots of pre-install user-state (one subdir per scenario). Committed to git so reviewers can inspect them.
- `tests/fixtures/sources/` — synthetic source trees (one per scenario) that exercise specific behaviours without depending on the real `src/user/`.
- Builder functions in `conftest.py` for ad-hoc fixture composition.

## CLI surface

```
python3 scripts/install.py [--dry-run] [--yes] [--verbose] [--tools=TOOLS] [--plugins=PLUGINS]
                           [--prune | --prune-only] [--dump-stage <path>] [--help]
```

`--dump-stage` is mutually exclusive with `--prune` / `--prune-only`. All other flags are mutually exclusive per the standard install / prune-only split.

## Implementation discipline

**Total TDD.** Every change follows the same arc; no production code lands without a failing test that justifies it.

1. **Test plan review** (collaborative, before any code). For the story, co-author a list of unit and integration test cases — names + brief intent + which fixture or scripted-IO scenario each exercises. The list captures the contract the implementation must satisfy. User signs off before red-phase work starts.
2. **Red phase.** Implement the tests. No production code yet. Tests fail by definition. Commit the red phase.
3. **Green phase.** Write the minimum production code to make the tests pass. No speculative scope, no extra abstractions beyond what the tests require.
4. **Refactor + verify.** Run the verification gate: `quality-reviewer` agent, `simplify` skill, full suite + lint + typecheck green.

**Test plan completeness criteria** — before signing off on a test plan, confirm:
- Every public function/class introduced has at least one unit test.
- Every documented behaviour has a corresponding integration test.
- Failure modes are covered (malformed input, missing files, collisions, non-interactive guard, etc.).
- Each test name names the *contract*, not the implementation (`test_user_settings_keys_are_preserved` not `test_json_union_strategy_invokes_recursive_merge`).

## Critical files

- `packages/installer/src/installer/core/model.py`
- `packages/installer/src/installer/core/io_port.py`
- `packages/installer/src/installer/core/staging.py`
- `packages/installer/src/installer/core/merge/registry.py` plus each strategy module
- `packages/installer/src/installer/tools/base.py` + per-tool adapters

## Verification

1. **Unit suite:** `uv run pytest packages/installer/tests/unit -q` — green; coverage ≥90% on touched modules.
2. **Integration suite:** `uv run pytest packages/installer/tests/integration -q` — green; assertions phrased as end-state contracts, not phase mechanics; scripted IOPort scripts fully consumed.
3. **Lint + typecheck:** `uv run ruff check packages/installer && uv run mypy --strict packages/installer/src` — clean.
4. **`--dump-stage` sanity:** dump the plan; confirm contents match the expected tree by inspection.

Or run all four in one shot: `make ci-installer` from the repo root.
