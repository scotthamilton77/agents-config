## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `run()` / `_run` | The lifecycle aggregator (§3.3). The public `run(pr, mode)` wrapper acquires the per-PR lock once; the lock-held `_run` chains the per-verb `_`-prefixed lifecycle steps, calls the end-of-cycle resolver, loops until terminal-for-CLI. |
| `_`-prefixed internal | A lock-assuming internal method whose docstring states `Caller must hold the per-ref lock (see lock()).` Public verbs are thin wrappers that acquire the lock then call the `_`-prefixed counterpart; `_run` chains the `_`-prefixed internals directly without nested lock acquisitions (§3.3). |
| End-of-cycle resolver | `resolve_end_of_cycle_phase(state)` — the priority-cascade function (§3.2) that picks the next phase from `fixes-pending` after each cycle. |
| `handle_verb_error` | The cross-cutting error handler called after each `_`-prefixed verb (§3.3). Decides whether to Continue (cycle proceeds) or Propagate (cycle exits with that tier's outcome). |
| `escalate_if_needed` | Cross-cutting hook that emits one `EscalationSink` event per item whose `disposition.kind ∈ {escalated, failed}` AND `escalation_filed == False` (plus the lifecycle retry-cap emit — `LIFECYCLE_PR_REVIEW_EXHAUSTED` / `LIFECYCLE_FIX_VERIFY_EXHAUSTED` — gated by `lifecycle_escalation_filed`). Called at the two `_run` exit sites — the loop-top terminal check and immediately before each Propagate re-raise; dedup-safe. Per §3.3. |
| `request_human_review_if_needed` | Cross-cutting hook (§4.6) called at the same two `_run` exit sites as `escalate_if_needed`. POSTs the `human-review-required` label via the gh adapter when `phase=human-gated` AND `state.human_review_label_added == False`; sets the flag. Dedup-safe. |
| Cluster contract | Cluster-bundling agent dispatch (§5). Cheap; local-first chain ollama → claude haiku → codex-mini. |
| Fix contract | Per-cluster fix agent dispatch (§5). `opus[1m]` orchestrator that decides per-comment disposition AND implements; emits a required `verify_checklist` claim (trust-but-verify). |
| `cap_guard` | The pre-push retry-budget guard (between `_fix` and `_push`), built today via `_cap_guard_step` in `_build_pipeline`. No-ops unless commits are queued AND `pr_review_retries_used >= pr_review_retries`; then sets `phase=HUMAN_GATED` + `LIFECYCLE_PR_REVIEW_EXHAUSTED`, refusing the push. |
| `_verify` | **DESIGNED, NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** — see [`c4-l3-verify.md`](c4-l3-verify.md). The designed pre-push mechanical gate (between `_fix` and `cap_guard`) that would run the operator-configured tier command (`proc.CommandRunner`, whole-branch, strongest `GateStrength`) and own a bounded fix↔verify convergence loop; would refuse the push on `fix_verify_retries` exhaustion via `phase=HUMAN_GATED` + `LIFECYCLE_FIX_VERIFY_EXHAUSTED`. None of `verify`, `GateStrength`, `VerifyVerdict`, or these two error codes exist in `packages/prgroom/src/` today. |
| Retry caps | **Built today**: the outer PR-review retry budget, `pr_review_retries` (default 5; `.prgroom.toml` / `PRGROOM_PR_REVIEW_RETRIES` / `--pr-review-retries`) bounds fix-push retries across cycles via the 0-indexed `pr_review_retries_used` counter → `LIFECYCLE_PR_REVIEW_EXHAUSTED`. **Designed, not yet implemented**: the inner `fix_verify_retries` budget (fix↔verify convergence loop → `LIFECYCLE_FIX_VERIFY_EXHAUSTED`) — see [`c4-l3-verify.md`](c4-l3-verify.md). Both are `LIFECYCLE_CAP` tier / exit 0, and re-arm by raising the relevant budget (entry-probe) or `poll` observing an external fix. |

## Purpose

Open the `src/prgroom/lifecycle/` container boundary and show its components. Answers: *what code inside the prgroom package actually runs the cycle? Where do the cross-cutting hooks (`escalate_if_needed`, `request_human_review_if_needed`) attach? Where do the lifecycle components reach for their collaborators in `src/prgroom/gh`, `src/prgroom/git`, `src/prgroom/agent`, `src/prgroom/prsession`?*

This is the most-detailed structural artifact in the set. It is the L3 zoom that an implementer reads alongside fca6.10 (the [Impl] Section 3 bead) when wiring `_run`.

## Component notes

### Lifecycle aggregator

**`_run`** is the entire control flow for one PR-grooming session. Its pseudocode skeleton (cleaned up from the design reference §3.3):

```python
def _run(pr, mode) -> PRGroomingState:     # caller holds the per-PR lock
    state = store.read(pr)                 # bootstrap zero-value if StateNotFoundError

    # Cross-cutting flush — applied at EVERY exit from _run. Per §3.3 the two
    # hooks fire at exactly two sites: the loop-top terminal check (clean phase
    # transitions) and immediately before each Propagate re-raise (terminal-error
    # transitions). Both are dedup-safe (per-item escalation_filed, lifecycle
    # lifecycle_escalation_filed, and human_review_label_added flags), so funnelling
    # every exit through this helper is a no-op on the second pass.
    def flush(s):
        s = escalate_if_needed(s)              # emit EscalationSink per qualifying item (§3.3)
        s = request_human_review_if_needed(s)  # POST human-review-required label if phase=human-gated (§4.6)
        return s

    while True:
        # Loop-top terminal check — flushes the hooks, then returns cleanly.
        if state.phase in {PRPhase.QUIESCED, PRPhase.HUMAN_GATED, PRPhase.MERGED}:
            return flush(state)

        # The cycle: each _-prefixed verb runs under handle_verb_error.
        # ⚠ ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY — this linearises the spec's §3.2 phase-dispatch (which
        # branches on state.phase, and elides the entry-time external-transition probe —
        # which also performs the retry-budget re-arm: from human-gated, a raised
        # --pr-review-retries clears LIFECYCLE_PR_REVIEW_EXHAUSTED, re-entering the
        # cycle. The design also calls for a sibling --fix-verify-retries re-arm for
        # the inner budget (DESIGNED, NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — see c4-l3-verify.md); only
        # the built outer --pr-review-retries budget exists today)
        # AND repeats the (call → handle_verb_error → maybe-Propagate) guard per verb,
        # both purely for readability. Do NOT copy either shape into the implementation:
        # the guard belongs in ONE place via a verb-step pipeline, and the dispatch
        # belongs on state.phase. See "Implementation guidance" after this block.
        #
        # cap_guard sits between _fix and _push: it no-ops unless commits are queued AND
        # pr_review_retries_used >= pr_review_retries, in which case it refuses the push by
        # setting phase=HUMAN_GATED (LIFECYCLE_PR_REVIEW_EXHAUSTED), which the loop-top
        # terminal check then breaks on
        # before _push/_reply/_resolve run. DESIGNED, NOT YET IMPLEMENTED: a verify
        # mechanical-gate step is planned to slot between _fix and cap_guard — see
        # c4-l3-verify.md; it does not exist in _build_pipeline today.
        for verb in (_poll, _cluster, _fix, cap_guard, _push, _reply, _resolve):
            try:
                state = verb(pr, state)
            except TaggedError as err:
                if handle_verb_error(err, state) is VerbDisposition.PROPAGATE:
                    state = flush(state)       # flush the hooks, then
                    raise                      # propagate — the run() wrapper maps the tier to an exit code
        # _rereview runs LAST (reply/resolve close out the round; rereview kicks off the
        # next). Its guard is the PERSISTED push_awaiting_rereview (last_review_invalidated_sha !=
        # last_rereviewed_sha) — NOT the cycle-relative push_uploaded_commits_this_cycle —
        # so a push that succeeded in a PRIOR cycle whose reply/resolve then Propagated is
        # still rereviewed on resume. _rereview stamps last_rereviewed_sha on success.
        if push_awaiting_rereview(state) and has_required_reviewers_to_refresh(state):
            try:
                state = _rereview(pr, state)
            except TaggedError as err:
                if handle_verb_error(err, state) is VerbDisposition.PROPAGATE:
                    state = flush(state)
                    raise

        # End-of-cycle phase resolution. NO hook calls here — they fire only at the two
        # exit sites above. A human-gated resolution is flushed (label POSTed) by the
        # loop-top terminal check on the next iteration.
        state = dataclasses.replace(state, phase=resolve_end_of_cycle_phase(state))
        store.write(pr, state)

        # Wait if the resolver landed in awaiting-review / idle
        if state.phase in {PRPhase.AWAITING_REVIEW, PRPhase.IDLE}:
            try:
                state = _wait(pr, state)
            except TaggedError as err:
                if handle_verb_error(err, state) is VerbDisposition.PROPAGATE:
                    state = flush(state)
                    raise

        # Loop back to terminal check (which flushes the hooks before any clean return)
```

The lock is acquired by the public `run()` wrapper (one level up); `_run` assumes it's held. The lock is released exactly when `_run` returns — at any of the terminal-for-CLI exits or on a Propagate failure. (`store`, `escalate_if_needed`, the verbs, etc. resolve through the injected deps surface — see Testability notes; they are written bare here for pseudocode brevity.)

> **Implementation guidance — factor the cycle, don't transcribe it.** The pseudocode above spells out each `_`-prefixed call with its own inline `handle_verb_error` guard purely for readability. Do **not** carry that per-verb repetition into the implementation — it duplicates the error-handling contract on every line and makes adding or reordering a verb a copy-paste. Model the cycle instead as an ordered **pipeline of verb steps** — e.g. a `list[VerbStep]` where `VerbStep` is a dataclass `(name: str, run: Callable[[Deps, PRGroomingState], PRGroomingState], guard: Callable[[PRGroomingState], bool])` — and iterate it once, applying the shared `handle_verb_error` → `{Continue, Propagate}` logic in exactly **one** place. Conditional verbs become a `guard` predicate (`_rereview`'s guard = `push_awaiting_rereview AND has_required_reviewers_to_refresh`), not an `if` in straight-line code. This keeps the §3.6 tier→decision mapping defined once and turns "add a verb" into a data change. (A strategy / pipeline pattern; the exact shape is settled during implementation of `src/prgroom/lifecycle`, not in this diagram.)

### Per-verb components

Each `_`-prefixed verb:

1. Is idempotent on its inputs — re-invocation against the same state is safe.
2. Atomically writes state via `prsession.Store.write` before returning (§3.3 atomicity contract).
3. Classifies its failures per §3.6 into one of the seven tiers and raises a tier-tagged error.

The dependencies between them are linear (the order in `_run`'s loop) — there is no fan-out, no parallel verb dispatch in MVP. **Cluster + fix do fan out across clusters within a single verb invocation** (each cluster is one cluster contract or fix contract subprocess), but the per-verb loops over clusters serialise.

### PR-memory: snapshot assembly + Decisions routing (§7)

Two §7 PR-memory responsibilities attach to existing verbs — no new verb. The PR remains the durable *publication* store (§7.0), but routing carries a **deliberate additive schema change**: a persisted `pending_memory: list[RoutedMemory]` field (`_fix` appends, `_reply` drains+clears, written atomically with the dispositions it derives from). The in-memory alternative loses the decision memo on *every* cycle that ends before `_reply` (a retry-cap trip, any transient gh failure on push), which is too lossy for a "the PR is the memory" design. The field is omit-when-empty, so `schema_version` stays `1` (old state files load `[]`). (Sibling additive fields from the same bead: `last_rereviewed_sha` and `last_review_invalidated_sha`, the resumable-rereview markers — see the `_rereview` component.)

- **Snapshot assembly (read path) — inside `_fix`, immediately before dispatch (§7.1).** `_fix` builds the complete-PR snapshot the fix contract reads via `pr_detail_path`: PR body (including the prgroom-maintained `## Decisions` block), labels, every review thread with its full reply-chain, and prior-round dispositions sourced from `prsession`. It also computes the per-item **`recurrence`** signal (§7.2) — derived from disposition history at assembly time, never stored. Capture is deferred to just-before-dispatch (not top-of-cycle `_poll`) to minimise the staleness window. The fix agent never calls `gh`.
- **CONTEXTUAL→PR routing (write path) — inside `_reply`, at reply time (§7.3).** `_fix` resolves the fix output's classified `memory` channel into `RoutedMemory` records appended to the persisted `state.pending_memory`; `_reply` drains and routes them (the agent only *declares*): a CONTEXTUAL entry with a `target_hint` rides out as a **thread reply** on that thread; a thread-less CONTEXTUAL entry is merged into the **`## Decisions` block** in the PR body via a `gh` **PATCH of the description** — an API edit, **not** a git commit and **not** a phase change, then `pending_memory` is cleared. **Two distinct idempotency mechanisms:** the `pending_memory` field provides *durability* (a memo is never LOST — it survives until a clean `_reply` clears it); the Decisions-block *routing dedup* needs **no extra flag** — prgroom owns the block between sentinel markers, keys entries by `(retry, source-item)`, and rewrites wholesale, so a same-retry re-run is byte-identical (contrast the auto-label's `human_review_label_added` flag). Thread-reply memory shares the per-reply non-idempotent-POST window that per-item replies do. Non-CONTEXTUAL classes are accepted-but-deferred (logged, not routed).

### The `_verify` mechanical gate (DESIGNED, NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

> **Status**: This subsystem is design-ratified but **0% implemented** — no `verify` step exists in `_build_pipeline` (`lifecycle/run.py`), no `verify` field on `PRGroomingState`, no `[verify]` config table. The only pre-push guard built today is `cap_guard` (§3.5 hard round cap — see the diagram above and its glossary row). The content below documents the target design; see [`c4-l3-verify.md`](c4-l3-verify.md) for the full component view.

`_verify` is the pre-push gate of record, designed to insert between `_fix` and `_push`. It **no-ops when `not has_queued`** (no fix commits to verify — mirrors `_push`'s degenerate no-op). When commits are queued it:

1. **Selects the tier** — the strongest `GateStrength` across the clean `FIXED` items (any `full` ⇒ `full`, else `lite`); `Disposition.gate` is typed/validated, so an absent or invalid gate on a `FIXED` item is a `CONTRACT_FIX_AUDIT_FAILED` (this makes `recommended_gate` load-bearing).
2. **Runs the mechanical gate** — the operator-configured tier command via `proc.CommandRunner`, whole-branch in the worktree. This run is **authoritative** — it is *not* byte-compared against the fix agent's `verify_checklist` claim; on divergence (agent claimed green, gate is red) the mechanical result wins and drives the convergence loop.
3. **Owns the bounded fix↔verify convergence loop** — on a RED gate, while `fix_verify_retries` remain it writes the gate output to a temp file and dispatches a whole-branch **REPAIR** fix (the `fix-repair` prompt, fed `verify_failure_path`), re-audits (orphan/sha with repair-attribution — repair commits are claimed by the verify-repair batch, not a review item), and re-runs the gate. This loop is internal to one cycle (not a state-machine transition) and its budget is independent of the outer cap because a verify-fail never pushes.
4. **Persists the `VerifyVerdict`** — batch-level on `PRGroomingState` (additive, omit-when-`None`; `schema_version` stays `1`), and surfaces it in the `status --json` `verify` block.
5. **Refuses the push on exhaustion** — by the **identical** mechanism as the §3.5 cap-guard: it sets `phase = HUMAN_GATED` + `LIFECYCLE_FIX_VERIFY_EXHAUSTED`, and the loop-top terminal check breaks before `_push`/`_reply`/`_resolve` run; the cross-cutting flush then emits the escalation + `human-review-required` label.

`_verify` requires the needed tier command to be configured in the `[verify]` table of the per-repo `.prgroom.toml`; if it is unconfigured, prgroom hard-stops at entry with `PRECONDITION_NO_VERIFY_CONFIG` (`PRECONDITION_USER_ERROR` tier, exit 2) — **not** a member of the no-work set. The full component view of this subsystem (the convergence loop, repair dispatch, `GateStrength` tier selection, and the `verify_checklist` contract) lives in [`c4-l3-verify.md`](c4-l3-verify.md); this lifecycle view defers that detail to it.

### Cross-cutting components

- **`escalate_if_needed`** fires at the two `_run` exit sites — the loop-top terminal check (clean transitions) and immediately before each Propagate re-raise (terminal-error transitions). It iterates `state.items` once and emits a single `Escalation` per item whose `disposition.kind ∈ {escalated, failed}` AND `escalation_filed == False`, then sets the per-item flag (plus the lifecycle retry-cap emit — `LIFECYCLE_PR_REVIEW_EXHAUSTED` / `LIFECYCLE_FIX_VERIFY_EXHAUSTED` — gated by `lifecycle_escalation_filed`). It dedupes on all three flags, so funnelling every exit through it is safe — an item already escalated in a prior cycle does not re-fire.
- **`request_human_review_if_needed`** fires at the same two exit sites as `escalate_if_needed`. When `phase=human-gated` AND `state.human_review_label_added` is still False, it POSTs the `human-review-required` label via the gh adapter and sets the flag. A human-gated phase written by `resolve_end_of_cycle_phase` is flushed (label POSTed) by the loop-top terminal check on the next iteration. The flag is reset on the next end-of-cycle resolution that writes a non-`human-gated` phase, so subsequent gates re-add the label.
- **`handle_verb_error`** is the cross-cutting error policy. It maps each failure-tier to a `{Continue, Propagate}` decision and decides whether to write `state.last_error`. The most subtle case: `CONTRACT_AUDIT_FAILED` returns Continue (the run loop continues) AND does NOT write `state.last_error` — the per-item `disposition.rationale` carries the cause for that case. End-of-cycle resolver priority 2 then promotes phase to `human-gated` on the next iteration.

### Quiescence components

- **`quiescence_predicate`** is a pure function over state. No I/O. No side effects. Called by `resolve_end_of_cycle_phase` at priority 5 and by `_wait` on every loop iteration.
- **`evaluate_reviewer_timeouts`** is an in-place state mutator called inline by `_poll` post-fetch. It iterates `state.reviewers` and applies the §4.1 auto-decline rules. Deadlines are derived per-evaluation (`clock() - last_request_at > review_start_timeout`), never stored — this is what makes resumability across crash gaps work (Sequence 4).

### Dependencies on sibling packages

`src/prgroom/lifecycle` depends on five sibling packages, each through a single Protocol:

| Sibling package | Protocol | What lifecycle uses it for |
|---|---|---|
| `src/prgroom/prsession` | `Store` | Per-PR state read / write / lock |
| `src/prgroom/agent` | `ClusterContract` + `FixContract` | Cluster / fix subprocess dispatch. Designed, not yet implemented: `_verify` reusing `FixContract` for whole-branch repair (see [`c4-l3-verify.md`](c4-l3-verify.md)) |
| `src/prgroom/gh` | `GitHub` (adapter) | All GitHub REST + GraphQL + label I/O |
| `src/prgroom/git` | `Git` (adapter) | Worktree-aware git ops — push to the PR branch (`_push`); commit-reachability reads for the §5 fix audit (`_fix`) |
| `src/prgroom/proc` | `CommandRunner` | Injected into the `gh` / `git` adapters' subprocess wrappers today. Designed, not yet implemented: running a verify tier command whole-branch in the worktree (`_verify`) |

`EscalationSink` is **not** a sibling package — it is defined within `src/prgroom/lifecycle` (the §1 layout gives escalation no dedicated module, and `escalate_if_needed` is its sole emitter). Per §5: `StderrSink` is wired as the production default; `FileSink` is implemented but not yet exposed via a CLI flag; a `bd` adapter is deferred to v2 and does not exist in code.

Lifecycle does NOT depend on `src/prgroom/cli` directly — config is loaded once by `cli.py` and passed in via the deps struct; `cli.py` is upstream of `_run` (it's the typer entry that builds the deps surface and calls `run()`).

## Testability notes

Per the design reference §1/§7 testability priority: every cross-module dependency goes behind a `@runtime_checkable` Protocol so `_`-prefixed verbs can be unit-tested against fakes. The wiring shape:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Deps:
    store: prsession.Store          # FileStore in prod, InMemoryStore in tests
    gh: gh.GitHub                   # gh-subprocess wrapper
    git: git.Git                    # worktree-aware git-subprocess wrapper
    cluster: agent.ClusterContract
    fix: agent.FixContract
    sink: EscalationSink            # lifecycle-internal; StderrSink wired today, FileSink implemented-not-wired, bd deferred to v2 (§5)
    clock: Callable[[], datetime]   # injected for §4 deadline derivation in tests
    # (no randomness used in MVP)
```

`_run(pr, mode)` is the testable entry — a method on a lifecycle object constructed with the `Deps` above, so the deps are injected at construction rather than passed positionally (matching the pseudocode signature). The public `run()` wrapper builds the deps, constructs the object, acquires the lock, calls `_run`, and releases. Tests inject fakes for `store` (the `InMemoryStore`), `gh` and `git` (recorded-subprocess fakes), `cluster` and `fix` (canned-disposition fakes), and `sink` (in-memory event collector). Concrete adapters structurally satisfy their Protocol — `mypy --strict` checks the fit; no production code is mocked of itself.

## What this diagram does NOT show

- **Per-verb `Item` and `Reviewer` micro-state machines.** Each `items[*].disposition.kind` and `reviewers[r].status` has its own progression; not drawn here. See [`data-view.md`](data-view.md) for the schema.
- **The detailed §3.6 error-code registry.** This diagram shows the `handle_verb_error` cross-cutting hook; the code list (`PRECONDITION_*`, `RUNTIME_*`, `CONTRACT_*`, `STATE_*`, `LIFECYCLE_*`) lives in the design reference §3.6.
- **Cluster contract / Fix contract internals.** This diagram surfaces them as components inside `src/prgroom/agent`; the per-contract provider chains, prompt templates, token-usage JSONL emitter, and audit-rule mechanics live in [`c4-l3-agent-dispatch.md`](c4-l3-agent-dispatch.md) (stub). A pending RCA / issue-analysis pass (under design, not yet ratified) may insert an analysis step between `_cluster` and `_fix` — see that stub for the forward note.
- **The fix↔verify subsystem internals.** This diagram surfaces `_verify` as a single lifecycle component and its collaborators (`proc.CommandRunner`, the repair dispatch via `FixContract`); the convergence-loop mechanics, `GateStrength` tier selection, repair-attribution audit, `verify_checklist` contract, and `VerifyVerdict` shape live in [`c4-l3-verify.md`](c4-l3-verify.md).
- **`prsession.Store` adapter selection logic.** This diagram surfaces the `Store` Protocol; the file / memory / bd adapter selection + transactional commit model live in [`c4-l3-prsession.md`](c4-l3-prsession.md) (stub).
- **The `gh` adapter's subprocess-wrapping detail.** Components inside `src/prgroom/gh` aren't broken out at L3 in MVP — the adapter is a single chokepoint over the `gh` subprocess; if it grows multiple modules (REST vs GraphQL vs label-mutation), a `c4-l3-gh.md` follows.
