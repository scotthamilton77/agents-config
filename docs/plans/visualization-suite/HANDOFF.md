# HANDOFF — Visualization Suite fablize session (next phase: "how does this actually work" discussion → V3 brainstorm → grouped spec)

For a fresh context resuming work on **agents-config-yf2ov.2** (epic:
"Visualization suite: PR shape, work-DAG, and codebase evolution", child of
milestone M5). Read this file, `findings.md`, and `bd show agents-config-yf2ov.2`
before doing anything. The epic is CLAIMED by the working session — re-claim if
resuming fresh.

## Session type and hard requirements

- This is a **fablize** session (frontier-window spec-fest): the deliverable is a
  **grouped dated design spec** in `docs/specs/`, NOT an implementation. Invoke the
  `fablize` skill's Phase-0 model check — the session must run on **Fable**
  (`claude-fable-5`); stop and tell the user if it isn't.
- Scott multitasks with long gaps between turns: **never park deliverables behind
  a localhost server**. Deliver self-contained HTML files on disk, `open` them,
  send via SendUserFile.
- **Use-cases before architecture**: pin moments/questions/actions and let Scott
  react to prototypes before any runtime/data-model questions.
- Delegation pattern that works: Fable writes judgment (briefs, data stories,
  edge inference, spec text); Sonnet workers (explicit model+effort on every
  dispatch) build D3/HTML mechanics; verify headlessly via playwright.

## Verification lessons (V2 round 1 — reuse these)

- playwright blocks `file://` — serve via scratch `python3 -m http.server 8642`
  from the prototype dir, kill after (`pkill -f "http.server 8642"`).
- **Cache-bust every re-verify** (`?final=2` query) — http.server sends no cache
  headers; a stale page produced two false blockers verbatim.
- playwright clicks target an element's **bbox center** — for curved SVG paths
  that's empty space. Real users click the visible curve/badge; make midpoint
  glyph badges first-class click targets and have verifiers click those.
- Verifier misjudgments to expect: closed panel content still in DOM/a11y tree
  ≠ visible; check computed styles/transforms, not tree presence.
- Palettes validated via the dataviz skill's `validate_palette.js` — plan hues
  (slots: blue/aqua/violet/magenta/orange) and edge-kind status colors both pass
  light+dark; light-mode aqua/magenta need direct labels (relief rule).

## Decisions already made (do not relitigate)

1. **Batch** (approved): F0 shared foundations + V1 PR-shape + V2 work-DAG + V3
   codebase evolution. One grouped spec covering all. At spec-PR merge: mint
   continuations under the still-open epic, release claim, stamp readiness
   labels — in that order.
2. **Runtime architecture (F0, user-approved): shared-canvas hybrid** —
   self-contained HTML artifacts; a lightweight loop makes them interactive with
   the agent when a session is attached. The session IS the agent; no backend.
3. **V1 verdicts** (see findings.md): estate treemap strong keep; attention
   ledger strong keep; constellation = evaluation criterion; impact sonar
   retired to per-file drill.
4. **V2 encoding spine** (validated, keep across views): solidity = provenance
   (solid encoded / dashed inferred); color+glyph = edge kind (gray → dependency,
   amber ≈ overlap, red ✕ conflict, green + synergy); step status filled/ring/
   outline; plan identity on the 5 validated categorical hues.
5. **V2 round-1 verdicts** (Scott, detail in findings.md): **A flight-plan
   lanes = STRONG KEEP** ("insights I had not seen in the beads dependency
   tree"). **B territory map = KEEP** with fix-soon usability items; new use
   case surfaced: contested regions → quality-policy targeting (guardrails/
   standards placement). **C constellation = unique value unproven**; candidate
   reframe: fleet-scale (20+ plans) zoom-out entry view — evaluation criterion
   for the spec, not a build item.

## State (files)

- `docs/plans/visualization-suite/prototype-v2/` (COMMITTED to main directly,
  commit `0605b08`, 2026-07-12, Scott-authorized admin bypass — an explicit
  exception to the worktree/PR discipline, not a precedent): `v2_variant_A.html`
  (lanes), `v2_variant_B.html` (territory), `v2_variant_C.html` (constellation)
  — all self-contained, demo-ready post fix pass, playwright-verified with
  computed-style evidence, delivered to Scott 2026-07-12.
  Alongside: `v2_data.json` (5 real specimen plans, 10 cross-plan edges — only
  e1 encoded in beads; 9 agent-inferred), `shared-conventions.md` (encoding
  spine + hard requirements), `brief_A/B/C_*.md`, `shots/`.
- V1 prototype: `prototype/pr-shape-proto-v3.html` + regen scripts (unchanged).
- `findings.md`: V1 verdicts + 15 principles; V2 round-1 verdicts with numbered
  feedback per variant + cross-cutting items. THE source for the fix pass and
  spec inputs.
- Bead `agents-config-yf2ov.2`: claimed, notes updated through V2 round 1.
- Known residuals (logged, minor): B logs an aria-hidden focus warning on panel
  close (blur before hiding); C has dead space above the cards.

## Next actions (in order)

1. **DONE (2026-07-12): operationalization discussion.** The seven agenda
   threads (below) resolved into six decisions D1–D6 in
   `operationalization-notes.md`, grounded in a three-provenance-tier working
   model: agenda items 1–5 produced D1–D6 (item 2, regeneration + freshness,
   split into D2 staleness + D3 trigger), while items 6 (scale) and 7
   (step-vs-backlog) folded into those decisions by composition rather than
   minting standalone ones (see that file's "Threads resolved by
   composition"). Two further decisions emerged during the discussion, outside
   the original seven agenda items: D7 (V3-thin) and D8 (model split, a
   process call on which model authors the spec/plans). Decision map: hybrid
   promotion (D1), staleness funnel (D2), overnight flag-only sweep (D3),
   packaging split (D4), annotation round-trip (D5), recommendation timing
   (D6), V3-thin (D7), model split (D8). OSS landscape surveyed and verified:
   `oss-landscape.md`. Judgment-dense spec inputs banked on Fable:
   `spec-judgment-inputs.md` (recommendation taxonomy, contested semantics,
   F0 scene-contract skeleton). These four files + `findings.md` are the
   complete spec-input corpus.
2. **V3 brainstorm/prototype: DEFERRED (decision D7).** No mockups before
   the spec. The spec's V3 section is thin (direction + evaluation criteria
   + continuation bead gating build on a future reaction round); F0 carries
   the two V3 reservations (time-keyed event stream in the scene contract,
   timeline-scrub affordance).
3. **Grouped spec WRITTEN (2026-07-12, on Fable — Scott overrode D8's
   Opus-suffices call for spec assembly):**
   `docs/specs/2026-07-12-visualization-suite-design.md`, on branch
   `viz-suite-spec`. Remaining: brainstorming-skill user review gate →
   completion gate → PR → at merge: mint continuations, stamp readiness
   labels, release claim on yf2ov.2 — in that order. Implementation plans
   follow the spec (Opus per D8).

## Operationalization questions (agenda for next-action 1)

How the prototypes were actually produced this round — the thing to
systematize:

- **Data**: `v2_data.json` was hand-authored by agents in-session — plan
  rosters and statuses pulled from real beads, step waypoints SYNTHESIZED by
  agent judgment (4–6 per plan), cross-plan edges inferred by reading specs
  (9 inferred vs 1 encoded; e1 = qptb4 blocks abn9.40.3 is the only
  beads-encoded cross-plan edge). No pipeline exists; every artifact was a
  bespoke agent work product.
- **Rendering**: agent-written self-contained D3 HTML per variant, verified
  by playwright subagents + human eyeball.

Open "how" threads the discussion should resolve (accumulated evidence in
findings.md):

1. **Data pipeline**: what regenerates plan/step/edge data — a deterministic
   extractor (beads + specs + graphify) plus an agent inference pass for
   edges/steps? Where does inferred-edge provenance live so it survives
   regeneration (a sidecar file? beads edges minted on acceptance?).
2. **Regeneration trigger + freshness**: artifact-per-moment (morning
   triage, on-demand command) vs live polling. Prior lean: regenerated
   artifact, no server (no-fragile-infra constraint).
3. **Packaging**: where does this live — a skill (agent regenerates on
   demand), a `packages/` CLI with an agent step, a command? Placement rule:
   capability-dependency decides shared vs Claude-only tree.
4. **Agent-in-the-loop mode**: shared-canvas hybrid is decided (F0) — but
   the concrete loop (annotation round-trip → agent processes notes → PR
   comments/bead edits; "recommend work-breakdown revision" action) needs a
   mechanism: file watch? paste-back JSON (V1's copy-notes button is the
   embryo)? session-attached local bridge?
5. **Recommendation engine**: edge drills carry agent recommendations
   (Scott's ask + meta-directive to derive my own taxonomy). When are these
   generated — at data-build time (batch, per edge/region) or interactively?
6. **Scale**: 5 plans hand-built; 20+ plans needs the plan-inclusion filter
   (built), C-as-entry-view hypothesis, and a data build that doesn't need a
   frontier model per refresh (cost: this round's data was Fable-judgment-
   heavy).
7. **Step synthesis vs backlog truth**: synthesized steps are a lossy view
   over real beads; the delta is itself a product feature (work-breakdown
   revision) — but the pipeline must keep the mapping step→bead-ids
   explicit, not vibes.

## Synthesis obligations for the spec (from Scott's V2 feedback)

- **Agent-recommendation taxonomy**: Scott's meta-directive — derive MY OWN
  recommendation types beyond his examples (per edge kind, per contested
  region, per step-vs-backlog delta). His examples: extract-a-slice-without-
  disrupting-sequencing; resequence/reprioritize; guardrails for contested
  regions.
- **Step-vs-backlog delta as an instrument**: synthesized step waypoints vs
  real bead hierarchy is a diff; "recommend work-breakdown revision" is a
  UI-initiated action (strongest new spec input).
- **Edge drills carry evidence + recommendations**: name real bead ids when an
  edge maps to actual dependency edges; mirror scene colors/glyphs in panels.
- **Step naming experiment** (low-pri): per-plan synthesized step names instead
  of bare order numbers; open question how it renders in lanes view.
- **Plan-inclusion filter** is F0-level (every view needs it at scale).

## Open questions to carry into V3 / spec

- V2 progression view: live update source (beads polling?) vs regenerated
  artifact per morning-triage moment.
- Weight-slider semantics explanation layer (V1 principle #2) — F0 spec text.
- "Contested" semantics: same-file vs same-region vs same-dependency-chain —
  sharpen before spec (Scott flagged the ambiguity explicitly).
