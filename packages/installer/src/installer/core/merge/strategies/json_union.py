"""Deep union-merge strategy for ``(SETTINGS_JSON, *)`` collisions (E.4).

When two ``settings.json`` payloads (e.g. a tool's and a plugin's) collide at
the same destination they are not a conflict — they are combined. This is the
Python port of the jq program at ``scripts/install.sh:431-456``; the bash
installer's observable behaviour is the contract this module matches. The merge
rules and the *structural* output formatting (2-space indent, object key order,
trailing newline) mirror ``jq .``; lexical number normalisation is the one
deliberate exception (quirk 3 below):

- dict + dict at a shared key -> recurse (deep merge);
- array + array at a shared key -> concatenate then jq-``unique`` (sort by
  jq's total order, then dedupe by value);
- scalar conflict at a shared key -> KEEP EXISTING;
- type mismatch at a shared key (dict-vs-scalar, array-vs-scalar, …)
  -> KEEP EXISTING;
- key only in incoming -> ADD it; key only in existing -> keep it;
- a top-level operand that is not an object -> the result is ``existing`` whole.

Two jq quirks are reproduced deliberately rather than "fixed":

1. **Empty-object quirk.** jq builds the merged object with ``… | add``; over
   an empty key-list ``[] | add`` evaluates to ``null``. So deep-merging two
   objects whose key-merge yields no keys produces JSON ``null`` — including
   nested ``{}`` + ``{}`` keys, which become ``null`` at that key.
2. **jq total order.** jq sorts and dedupes arrays by its own total order:
   ``null < false < true < number < string < array < object``, with arrays
   compared element-wise (length tiebreak) and objects compared by their
   sorted key-array first then their values in key order. ``_jq_sort_key``
   reproduces that ordering.

One jq behaviour is deliberately NOT reproduced:

3. **Number lexemes are not byte-preserved.** jq echoes a number's source form
   (``1e3`` stays ``1E+3``, ``1.50`` stays ``1.50``); this port round-trips
   through ``json.loads``/``json.dumps`` and canonicalises them (``1e3`` ->
   ``1000.0``, ``1.50`` -> ``1.5``). Common-case numbers round-trip faithfully
   (``1`` vs ``1.0`` stay distinct; integral floats and big ints keep their
   form). Accepted, not fixed: every ``settings.json`` source is canonical-
   number JSON — no template carries scientific-notation or trailing-zero
   literals — and the golden-master parity suite is the backstop should one
   ever appear.

Output bytes are canonical ``jq .`` formatting: 2-space indent and a single
trailing newline. ``jq .`` does NOT sort object keys — it preserves each
object's insertion order. The bash installer emits the merge with ``jq .``
(``install.sh:456``), not ``jq -S``, so this port matches that: the deep-merge
skeleton is constructed in sorted-key order by :func:`_deep_merge` (mirroring
jq's ``($a|keys)+($b|keys)|unique``, which sorts by Unicode codepoint), while
any object jq passes through verbatim — a key present on only one side whose
value is an object, or an object nested inside an array — keeps its original
insertion order.

Irreconcilable input (a ``None`` side, or bytes that are not valid JSON) raises
:class:`CollisionError` naming both source paths, mirroring jq aborting on bad
input rather than silently fabricating an empty object.
