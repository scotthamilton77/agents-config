"""Subprocess lifecycle wrapper for agent dispatch (§5 subprocess wrapper).

Owns the ``subprocess`` plumbing for the four agent CLIs (``claude -p`` /
``codex exec`` / ``opencode run`` / ``ollama``): it writes the contract JSON to a
temp file passed **by path** (§5 "JSON, written to a file passed by path") for the
file-capable CLIs — a tool-less ``ollama run`` child instead gets the payload and
referenced file contents INLINE in its prompt (see :func:`_input_section`) — builds
the per-invoker argv/stdin shape, enforces a per-contract wall-clock budget
(kills the child and raises a timeout-tagged error on overrun), and terminates the
child when a :class:`threading.Event` cancel-token is set.

The single OS seam is the :class:`ProcessHandle` Protocol — a thin ``Popen``
facade — injected as the ``spawn`` callable. Production wires :func:`_popen_spawn`;
tests inject a fake that returns recorded behavior, so kill-on-timeout and
kill-on-cancel are proven without spawning a real CLI. This mirrors the
foundation's ``CommandRunner`` seam (recorded fakes, not mocks).

The runner is intentionally **classification-free**: it reports the child's
returncode + stderr faithfully and raises only for timeout/cancel. Mapping a
non-zero exit (quota/auth/network) onto the fallback ladder is the dispatcher's
job — keeping that policy out of the boundary keeps this layer a pure mechanism.
